                    Jan 2023</em></a><br>
            After a succesful CLI app, the cafe had exponentially grown, and now with several stores, but no centralised
            data store, they wanted us to create an ETL pipeline stored in the cloud<br>
            so they could use bI software to generate meaningful data and not miss out on potential profitable business
            schemes.<br>
            I learned about using Scrum to acheive an Agile way of working with a team of colleagues whom i hadnt worked
            with before. Techincally I learned about <br>
            AWS (Lambda [layers and triggers], S3, EC2, CloudFormation[IAC], CloudWatch, and Redhift), GitHub Actions
            (CI/CD pipeline) Docker and Grafana </li>

                    2022</em></a><br>
            My first ever Python project for Generation. We were approached by a 'Cafe business' who wanted us to
            develop a CLI app to help keep track of their stocka nd ordering.<br>
            We were tasked with applying basic CRUD operations on CSV data, and introduced to unit testing (Unittest,
            Pytest), functions, and OOP</li>
    </ul>
